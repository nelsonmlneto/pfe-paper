Introduction
	- context
	- problem: the repetitive work of writing tests scripts for different versions of the same system
	- proposal: a tool that generates tests scripts for several contexts from a single higher-level script
Related Work
	- ?
Case Study
	- explain that is a Smart Home Energy Management System
	- explain that we developed 4 versions (3 webs and 1 mobile)
	- list of features
	- prints of one version.
UI testing from a higher-level script
	- approach: to drive the browser as users do and etc (Selenium and Selendroid)
	- talk about Tobias
	- tell that we wrote test cases using Tobias for the 4 versions, showing that we can write testes using a higher-level language.
Proposal
	- After showing that we can write testes in higher-level language using regular tobias, we explain some changes in TSLT that would 		- make it better and easier.
Conclusion
	- Results
	- Improving Tobias would allow to write such test generator
	- It could be useful for product lines (automatic testing with variation)
