Tests generation for adapting UIs with Tobias

motivation :
Adapting UIs on numerous platforms
define UI and Adapting
high quality software expected

problem :
tests are essential
relie on the implementation
so its a lot of repetitive work

solution :
we used Tobias that takes charge of the combinatorial
and allows to abstract JUnit implementations details
so we could focus on the test itself
for a test suite, all tests follow same use case
therefore they share the same logical proceeding
which can be abstracted
and then derived for each implementation
thus reducing the differences between each test
and using the same approach for each test leaded to use similar implementations
which could be furthermore shared between tests
so differences could be minimal, only implementation variation details
and through Tobias we are able to generate good tests, from scripts that are alike
next would be to be able to generate these alike-scripts,
that given abstract use case and implementation variations the whole test suite could be generated

Results :
similarity in files, variation confinement
hence generability

Discussion :
Improving Tobias would allow to write such test generator
It could be useful for product lines (automatic testing with variation)

=== Related Work : (Julien's suggestions)
Quality is very important in the software industry, and so are tests. They have been extensively studied by literature [TODO: some refs].
In a more modern context, Continuous Integration (CI) has been gaining popularity, hence is the need of automated tests.
An automated test is usually generated for the exact goal to achieve, then is executed and its results are compared to those expected, finally a report is constructed with a summary of the failures encountered. The report can be easily generated by IDE plugins as long as tests are well designed and use testing libraries (like JUnit). 
The increasing popularity of web-based softwares has obliged to develop tools to perform tests on these devices. Among them, are Selenium for browser-based applications, and Selendroid for Android applications.
Furthermore, GUIs have proven to be difficult to test, requiring new ways to verify them.
So automation of UI testing may be achieved by several means :
- using Finite State Machine-based modeling which suffers scaling problems [TODO: ref]
- creating an abstraction of the UI which is then tested in place of the UI itself [TODO: ref Sophie's paper]
- automated planning for hierarchical test case generation may be used which involves genetic algorithms [Ref: get https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing#cite_note-Mem01-5]
- using "capture and replay" method is rejected, as it would involve one capture per version [TODO: ref]
